# AI Rover for Simulated Planetary Exploration 🚀

A Mars-like terrain simulation where an AI-powered rover explores the surface, avoids obstacles, and identifies features of interest (such as craters, rocks, or ice-like deposits) using computer vision or rule-based AI.

## 🌌 Project Overview

This project simulates an AI rover's autonomous exploration of extraterrestrial terrain. It blends computer vision, rule-based logic, and navigation algorithms to enable the rover to:
- Navigate a planetary-like surface
- Avoid obstacles
- Detect and classify terrain features

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mvnikhitha/AI-Rover-for-Simulated-Planetary-Exploration.git
   cd AI-Rover-for-Simulated-Planetary-Exploration
2. ** Install Dependencies **
3. ** Run the Simulation **
   ```bash
   python main.py
## 🧾 Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib *(if visualization is included)*

## 🖼️ Sample Terrain

The `terrain_map.png` is a mock Mars terrain over which the rover navigates.  
You can replace it with any top-down satellite image or generated terrain map for further testing.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Integrate reinforcement learning for path planning  
- Add dynamic obstacles  
- Extend terrain generation to include random craters and slopes  
- Implement ROS/Gazebo simulation
